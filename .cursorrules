# Cursor Rules — Sports Admin

## Purpose
Provide reliable, structured sports data that downstream apps (like Scroll Down Sports) can trust.

## Core Values
- Stability over speed
- Predictable schemas
- Traceable changes
- Zero silent failures

## Decision Making
- If something is ambiguous, stop and clarify in TODO or comments.
- Never guess on data interpretation.
- Prefer explicit validation over “assuming it works”.

## Data Rules
- All ingested data should be normalized before storage.
- Every transformation must be explainable.
- Add validation checks when feasible.
- Log failures. Do not ignore them.

## Code Practices
- Small, focused modules.
- Avoid overly clever pipelines.
- Prefer clarity over micro-optimizations.
- Keep side effects obvious (no hidden mutations).

## Breaking Changes
If a schema or behavior change affects consumers:
- document it clearly
- bump versions or flags when appropriate
- never break consumers silently

## Documentation
When touching data or logic:
- update README with any workflow or API changes
- briefly note changes in CHANGELOG
- add comments on WHY choices were made

## Testing
- Add tests for parsing, validation, and transformers.
- When bugs are fixed, add regression coverage.

## What NOT to do
- Don’t refactor “for style”.
- Don’t introduce new dependencies casually.
- Don’t hide errors to keep pipelines running.

## Golden Rule
If downstream systems depend on it,
be boring, explicit, and reliable.
